# Menuplan

This is a personal project to generate weekly mealplans for myself. The code selects recipes stored as .txt files in the /recipes directory according to rules defined in config.txt. Rules are available to avoid repetition of certain flavors or ingredients for a given number of days. For example, a rule can be defined to avoid recipes containing fish for 4 meals after one has been selected. Generally, recipe ingredients are not repeated for 2 meals. For example, if a pasta dish was selected as lunch for Tuesday, no recipe containg pasta as main ingredient will be selected for dinner on Tuesday or lunch on Wednesday. Although fields for preparation time and nutritional value are prepared in the recipe files, there is currently no functionality for these fields to influence the meal plan.

menu.py contains all necessary background functionality. menu_gui.py contains the GUI and is the recommended way of using the meal planner. Via the GUI, the recipe library can be accessed and edited easily. The 'options' button allows for customization of the meal planner rules and the number of days for which to plan meals. Use the 'GENERATE' button to fill the selection boxes with meals.
